    + "<h1>How The Camel Got His Hump</h1>"
    + "<h2>Rudyard Kipling</h2>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "<p>In the beginning of years, when the world was so new and all, and the Animals were just beginning to work for Man, there was a Camel, and he lived in the middle of a Howling Desert because he did not want to work; and besides, he was a Howler himself. So he ate sticks and thorns and tamarisks and milkweed and prickles, most “scruciating idle; and when anybody spoke to him he said “Humph!” Just “Humph!” and no more.</p>"
    + "<p>Presently the Horse came to him on Monday morning, with a saddle on his back and a bit in his mouth, and said, “Camel, O Camel, come out and trot like the rest of us.”</p>"
    + "<p>“Humph!” said the Camel; and the Horse went away and told the Man.</p>"
    + "<p>Presently the Dog came to him, with a stick in his mouth, and said, “Camel, O Camel, come and fetch and carry like the rest of us.”</p>"
    + "<p>“Humph!” said the Camel; and the Dog went away and told the Man.</p>"
    + "<p>Presently the Ox came to him, with the yoke on his neck and said, “Camel, O Camel, come and plough like the rest of us.”</p>"
    + "<p>“Humph!” said the Camel; and the Ox went away and told the Man.</p>"
    + "<p>At the end of the day the Man called the Horse and the Dog and the Ox together, and said, “Three, O Three, I'm very sorry for you (with the world so new-and-all); but that Humph-thing in the Desert can't work, or he would have been here by now, so I am going to leave him alone, and you must work double-time to make up for it.”</p>"
    + "<p>That made the Three very angry (with the world so new-and-all), and they held a palaver, and an <i>indaba</i>, and a <i>punchayet</i>, and a pow-wow on the edge of the Desert; and the Camel came chewing on milkweed <i>most</i> “scruciating idle, and laughed at them. Then he said “Humph!” and went away again.</p>"
    + "<p>Presently there came along the Djinn in charge of All Deserts, rolling in a cloud of dust (Djinns always travel that way because it is Magic), and he stopped to palaver and pow-pow with the Three.</p>"
    + "<p>“Djinn of All Deserts,” said the Horse, “is it right for any one to be idle, with the world so new-and-all?”</p>"
    + "<p>“Certainly not,” said the Djinn.</p>"
    + "<p>“Well,” said the Horse, “there's a thing in the middle of your Howling Desert (and he's a Howler himself) with a long neck and long legs, and he hasn't done a stroke of work since Monday morning. He won't trot.”</p>"
    + "<p>“Whew!” said the Djinn, whistling, “that's my Camel, for all the gold in Arabia! What does he say about it?”</p>"
    + "<p>“He says ‘Humph!’” said the Dog; “and he won't fetch and carry.”</p>"
    + "<p>“Does he say anything else?”</p>"
    + "<p>“Only ‘Humph!’; and he won't plough,” said the Ox.</p>"
    + "<p>“Very good,” said the Djinn. “I'll humph him if you will kindly wait a minute.”</p>"
    + "<p>The Djinn rolled himself up in his dust-cloak, and took a bearing across the desert, and found the Camel most “scruciatingly idle, looking at his own reflection in a pool of water.</p>"
    + "<p>“My long and bubbling friend,” said the Djinn, “what's this I hear of your doing no work, with the world so new-and-all?”</p>"
    + "<p>“Humph!” said the Camel.</p>"
    + "<p>The Djinn sat down, with his chin in his hand, and began to think a Great Magic, while the Camel looked at his own reflection in the pool of water.</p>"
    + "<p>“You've given the Three extra work ever since Monday morning, all on account of your “scruciating idleness,” said the Djinn; and he went on thinking Magics, with his chin in his hand.</p>"
    + "<p>“Humph!” said the Camel.</p>"
    + "<p>“I shouldn't say that again if I were you,” said the Djinn; “you might say it once too often. Bubbles, I want you to work.”</p>"
    + "<p>And the Camel said “Humph!” again; but no sooner had he said it than he saw his back, that he was so proud of, puffing up and puffing up into a great big lolloping humph.</p>"
    + "<p>“Do you see that?” said the Djinn. “That's your very own humph that you've brought upon your very own self by not working. To-day is Thursday, and you've done no work since Monday, when the work began. Now you are going to work.”</p>"
    + "<p>“How can I,” said the Camel, “with this humph on my back?”</p>"
    + "<p>“That's made a-purpose,” said the Djinn, “all because you missed those three days. You will be able to work now for three days without eating, because you can live on your humph; and don't you ever say I never did anything for you. Come out of the Desert and go to the Three, and behave. Humph yourself!”</p>"
    + "<p>And the Camel humphed himself, humph and all, and went away to join the Three. And from that day to this the Camel always wears a humph (we call it “hump” now, not to hurt his feelings); but he has never yet caught up with the three days that he missed at the beginning of the world, and he has never yet learned how to behave.</p>"

    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;THE Camel's hump is an ugly lump<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which well you may see at the Zoo;<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;But uglier yet is the hump we get<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From having too little to do.<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiddies and grown-ups too-oo-oo,<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;If we haven't enough to do-oo-oo,<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We get the hump—<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cameelious hump—<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;The hump that is black and blue!<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;We climb out of bed with a frouzly head<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a snarly-yarly voice.<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;We shiver and scowl and we grunt and we growl<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At our bath and our boots and our toys;<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;And there ought to be a corner for me<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;(And I know there is one for you)<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we get the hump—<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cameelious hump—<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;The hump that is black and blue!<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;The cure for this ill is not to sit still,<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or frowst with a book by the fire;<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;But to take a large hoe and a shovel also,<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dig till you gently perspire;<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you will find that the sun and the wind.<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Djinn of the Garden too,<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have lifted the hump—<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrible hump—<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;The hump that is black and blue!<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;I get it as well as you-oo-oo—<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;If I haven't enough to do-oo-oo—<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all get hump—<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cameelious hump—<br/>"
    + "&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiddies and grown-ups too!<br/>"
