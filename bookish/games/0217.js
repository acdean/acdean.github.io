    + "But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?<br/>"
    + "It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!<br/>"
    + "Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,<br/>"
    + "Who is already sick and pale with grief,<br/>"
    + "That thou her maid art far more fair than she.<br/>"
    + "Be not her maid since she is envious;<br/>"
    + "Her vestal livery is but sick and green,<br/>"
    + "And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.<br/>"
    + "It is my lady, O it is my love!<br/>"
    + "O, that she knew she were!<br/>"
    + "She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?<br/>"
    + "Her eye discourses, I will answer it.<br/>"
    + "I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks.<br/>"
    + "Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<br/>"
    + "Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br/>"
    + "To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br/>"
    + "What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br/>"
    + "The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,<br/>"
    + "As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven<br/>"
    + "Would through the airy region stream so bright<br/>"
    + "That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br/>"
    + "See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.<br/>"
    + "O that I were a glove upon that hand,<br/>"
    + "That I might touch that cheek."

    + "As glorious to this night, being o'er my head,<br/>"
    + "As is a winged messenger of heaven<br/>"
    + "Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes<br/>"
    + "Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<br/>"
    + "When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds<br/>"
