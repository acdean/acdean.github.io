    + "<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>"
    + "<p>"
    + "In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece<br/>"
    + "The princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd,<br/>"
    + "Have to the port of Athens sent their ships<br/>"
    + "Fraught with the ministers and instruments<br/>"
    + "Of cruel war. Sixty and nine that wore<br/>"
    + "Their crownets regal from th' Athenian bay<br/>"
    + "Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made<br/>"
    + "To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures<br/>"
    + "The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,<br/>"
    + "With wanton Paris sleeps-and that's the quarrel.<br/>"
    + "To Tenedos they come,<br/>"
    + "And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge<br/>"
    + "Their war-like fraughtage. Now on Dardan plains<br/>"
    + "The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch<br/>"
    + "Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,<br/>"
    + "Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,<br/>"
    + "And Antenorides, with massy staples<br/>"
    + "And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,<br/>"
    + "Sperr up the sons of Troy.<br/>"
    + "Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits<br/>"
    + "On one and other side, Troyan and Greek,<br/>"
    + "Sets all on hazard-and hither am I come<br/>"
    + "A Prologue arm'd, but not in confidence<br/>"
    + "Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited<br/>"
    + "In like conditions as our argument,<br/>"
    + "To tell you, fair beholders, that our play<br/>"
    + "Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,<br/>"
    + "Beginning in the middle; starting thence away,<br/>"
    + "To what may be digested in a play.<br/>"
    + "Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are;<br/>"
    + "Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.<br/>"

    + "<p><i>Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS</i></p>"
    + "<p>TROILUS<br/>"
    + "Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again.<br/>"
    + "Why should I war without the walls of Troy<br/>"
    + "That find such cruel battle here within?<br/>"
    + "Each Troyan that is master of his heart,<br/>"
    + "Let him to field; Troilus, alas, hath none!<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "Will this gear ne'er be mended?<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>TROILUS<br/>"
    + "The Greeks are strong, and skilful to their strength,<br/>"
    + "Fierce to their skill, and to their fierceness valiant;<br/>"
    + "But I am weaker than a woman's tear,<br/>"
    + "Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,<br/>"
    + "Less valiant than the virgin in the night,<br/>"
    + "And skilless as unpractis'd infancy.<br/>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "Well, I have told you enough of this; for my part,<br/>"
    + "I'll not meddle nor make no farther. He that will have a cake<br/>"
    + "out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>TROILUS<br/>"
    + "Have I not tarried?<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry the bolting.<br/>"
    + "</p>"

    + "Have I not tarried?<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "Ay, the bolting; but you must tarry the leavening.<br/>"

    + "<p>TROILUS<br/>"
    + "Still have I tarried.<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word<br/>"
    + "“hereafter” the kneading, the making of the cake, the heating<br/>"
    + "of the oven, and the baking; nay, you must stay the cooling too,<br/>"
    + "or you may chance to burn your lips.<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>TROILUS<br/>"
    + "Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,<br/>"
    + "Doth lesser blench at suff'rance than I do.<br/>"
    + "At Priam's royal table do I sit;<br/>"
    + "And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts-<br/>"
    + "So, traitor, then she comes when she is thence.<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "Well, she look'd yesternight fairer than ever I saw her<br/>"
    + "look, or any woman else.<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>TROILUS<br/>"
    + "I was about to tell thee: when my heart,<br/>"
    + "As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,<br/>"
    + "Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,<br/>"
    + "I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,<br/>"
    + "Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile.<br/>"
    + "But sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness<br/>"
    + "Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's-well,<br/>"
    + "go to- there were no more comparison between the women. But, for<br/>"
    + "my part, she is my kinswoman; I would not, as they term it,<br/>"
    + "praise her, but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as<br/>"
    + "I did. I  will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit; but-<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>TROILUS<br/>"
    + "O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus-<br/>"
    + "When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd,<br/>"
    + "Reply not in how many fathoms deep<br/>"
    + "They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad<br/>"
    + "In Cressid's love. Thou answer'st “She is fair”-<br/>"
    + "Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart-<br/>"
    + "Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,<br/>"
    + "Handlest in thy discourse. O, that her hand,<br/>"
    + "In whose comparison all whites are ink<br/>"
    + "Writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure<br/>"
    + "The cygnet's down is harsh, and spirit of sense<br/>"
    + "Hard as the palm of ploughman! This thou tell'st me,<br/>"
    + "As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;<br/>"
    + "But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,<br/>"
    + "Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me<br/>"
    + "The knife that made it.<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "I speak no more than truth.<br/>"

    + "Thou dost not speak so much.<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "Faith, I'll not meddle in it. Let her be as she is: if<br/>"
    + "she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be not, she has the<br/>"
    + "mends in her own hands.<br/>"
    + "</p>"

    + "What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair as<br/>"
    + "Helen. An she were not kin to me, she would be as fair a Friday<br/>"
    + "as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not an she were a<br/>"

    + "Say I she is not fair?<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "<p>PANDARUS<br/>"
    + "I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to stay<br/>"
    + "behind her father. Let her to the Greeks; and so I'll tell her<br/>"
    + "the next time I see her. For my part, I'll meddle nor make no<br/>"

    + "When with your blood you daily paint her thus.<br/>"
    + "I cannot fight upon this argument;<br/>"
    + "It is too starv'd a subject for my sword.<br/>"
    + "But Pandarus-O gods, how do you plague me!<br/>"
    + "I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;<br/>"
    + "And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo<br/>"
    + "As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.<br/>"

    + "What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?<br/>"
    + "Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl;<br/>"
