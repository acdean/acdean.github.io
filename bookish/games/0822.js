    + "<h1>The Flowers of Evil</h1>"
    + "<h2>Charles Baudelaire</h2>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "<h3>Echoes</h3>"
    + "<blockquote>"
    + "In Nature's temple, living columns rise,<br/>"
    + "Which oftentimes give tongue to words subdued,<br/>"
    + "And Man traverses this symbolic wood,<br/>"
    + "Which looks at him with half familiar eyes,<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "Like lingering echoes, which afar confound<br/>"
    + "Themselves in deep and sombre unity,<br/>"
    + "As vast as Night, and like transplendency,<br/>"
    + "The scents and colours to each other respond.<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "And scents there are, like infant's flesh as chaste,<br/>"
    + "As sweet as oboes, and as meadows fair,<br/>"
    + "And others, proud, corrupted, rich and vast,<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "Which have the expansion of infinity,<br/>"
    + "Like amber, musk and frankincense and myrrh,<br/>"
    + "That sing the soul's and senses' ecstasy.<br/>"
    + "</blockquote>"
    + "<h3>The Sick Muse</h3>"
    + "<blockquote>"
    + "Alas—my poor Muse—what aileth thee now?<br/>"
    + "Thine eyes are bedimmed with the visions of Night,<br/>"
    + "And silent and cold—I perceive on thy brow<br/>"
    + "In their turns—Despair and Madness alight.<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "A succubus green, or a hobgoblin red,<br/>"
    + "Has it poured o'er thee Horror and Love from its urn?<br/>"
    + "Or the Nightmare with masterful bearing hath led<br/>"
    + "Thee to drown in the depths of some magic Minturne?<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "I wish, as the health-giving fragrance I cull,<br/>"
    + "That thy breast with strong thoughts could for ever be full,<br/>"
    + "And that rhymthmic'ly flowing—thy Christian blood<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "Could resemble the olden-time metrical-flood,<br/>"
    + "Where each in his turn reigned the father of Rhymes<br/>"
    + "Phoebus—and Pan, lord of Harvest-times.<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "</blockquote>"
    + "<h3>The Venal Muse</h3>"
    + "<blockquote>"
    + "Oh Muse of my heart—so fond of palaces old,<br/>"
    + "Wilt have—when New Year speeds its wintry blast,<br/>"
    + "Amid those tedious nights, with snow o'ercast,<br/>"
    + "A log to warm thy feet, benumbed with cold?<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "Wilt thou thy marbled shoulders then revive<br/>"
    + "With nightly rays that through thy shutters peep?<br/>"
    + "And—void thy purse and void thy palace—reap<br/>"
    + "A golden hoard within some azure hive?<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "Thou must, to earn thy daily bread, each night,<br/>"
    + "Suspend the censer like an acolyte,<br/>"
    + "Te-Deums sing, with sanctimonious ease,<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "Or as a famished mountebank, with jokes obscene<br/>"
    + "Essay to lull the vulgar rabble's spleen;<br/>"
    + "Thy laughter soaked in tears which no one sees.<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "</blockquote>"
    + "<h3>The Evil Monk</h3>"
    + "<blockquote>"
    + "The cloisters old, expounded on their walls<br/>"
    + "With paintings, the Beatic Verity,<br/>"
    + "The which—adorning their religious halls,<br/>"
    + "Enriched the frigidness of their Austerity.<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "In days when Christian seeds bloomed o'er the land,<br/>"
    + "Full many a noble monk unknown to-day,<br/>"
    + "Upon the field of tombs would take his stand,<br/>"
    + "Exalting Death in rude and simple way.<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "My soul is a tomb where—bad monk that I be—<br/>"
    + "I dwell and search its depths from all eternity,<br/>"
    + "And nought bedecks the walls of the odious spot.<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "Oh sluggard monk! when shall I glean aright<br/>"
    + "From the living spectacle of my bitter lot,<br/>"
    + "To mold my handywork and mine eyes' Delight?<br/>"
    + "</p>"
    + "</blockquote>"
    + "<h3>The Enemy</h3>"
    + "<blockquote>"
    + "My childhood was nought but a ravaging storm,<br/>"
    + "Enlivened at times by a brilliant sun;<br/>"
    + "The rain and the winds wrought such havoc and harm<br/>"
    + "That of buds on my plot there remains hardly one.<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "Behold now the Fall of ideas I have reached,<br/>"
    + "And the shovel and rake one must therefore resume,<br/>"
    + "In collecting the turf, inundated and breached,<br/>"
    + "Where the waters dug trenches as deep as a tomb.<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "And yet these new blossoms, for which I craved,<br/>"
    + "Will they find in this earth—like a shore that is laved—<br/>"
    + "The mystical fuel which vigour imparts?<br/>"
    + "<br/>"
    + "Oh misery!—Time devours our lives,<br/>"
    + "And the enemy black, which consumeth our hearts<br/>"
    + "On the blood of our bodies, increases and thrives!<br/>"
    + "</blockquote>"
