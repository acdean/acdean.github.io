    + "<p>Doctor Phillips had not been in the Hotel Lion d'Or five minutes before Margaret Pullen took him upstairs to see her baby. She was becoming terribly anxious about her. They encountered Captain Ralph Pullen on the staircase.</p>"
    + "<p>“Hullo! young man, and what have <em>you</em> been doing to yourself?” exclaimed the doctor.</p>"
    + "<p>He was certainly looking ill. His face was chalky white, and his eyes seemed to have lost their brightness and colour.</p>"
    + "<p>“Been up racketing late at night?” continued Doctor Phillips. “What is Miss Leyton about, not to look after you better?”</p>"
    + "<p>“No, indeed, Doctor,” replied the young man with a smile, “I am sure my sister-in-law will testify to the good hours I have kept since here. But I have a headache this morning—a rather bad one,” he added, with his hand to the nape of his neck.</p>"
    + "<p>“Perhaps this place doesn't agree with you—it was always rather famous for its smells, if I remember aright! However, I am going to see Miss Ethel Pullen now, and when I have finished with her, I will look after you!”</p>"
    + "<p>“No, thank you, Doctor,” said Ralph laughing, as he descended the stairs. “None of your nostrums for me!  Keep them for the baby!”</p>"
    + "<p>“He is not looking well,” observed Doctor Phillips to Margaret, as they walked on together.</p>"
    + "<p>“I don't think he is, now you point it out to me, but I have not noticed it before,” replied Margaret. “I am sure he has been living quietly enough whilst here!”</p>"
    + "<p>The infant was lying as she had now done for several days past—quite tranquil and free from pain, but inert and half asleep. The doctor raised her eyelids and examined her eyeballs—felt her pulse and listened to her heart—but he did not seem to be satisfied.</p>"
    + "<p>“What has this child been having?” he asked abruptly.</p>"
    + "<p>“Having, Doctor? Why! nothing, of course, but her milk, and I have always that from the same cow!”</p>"
    + "<p>“No opium—no soothing syrup, nor quackeries of any kind?”</p>"
    + "<p>“Certainly not! You know how often you have warned me against anything of the sort!”</p>"
    + "<p>“And no one has had the charge of her, except you and the nurse here? You can both swear she has never been tampered with?”</p>"
    + "<p>“O! I think so, certainly, yes! Baby has never been from under the eye of one or the other of us. A young lady resident in the hotel—a Miss Brandt—has often nursed her and played with her, but one of us has always been there at the time.”</p>"
    + "<p>“A Miss—what did you say?” demanded the doctor, sharply.</p>"
    + "<p>“A Miss Brandt—a very good-natured girl, who is fond of children!”</p>"
    + "<p>“Very well then! I will go at once to the pharmacien's, and get a prescription made up for your baby, and I hope that your anxiety may soon be relieved!”</p>"
    + "<p>“O! thank you, Doctor, so much!” exclaimed Margaret “I knew you would do her good, as soon as you saw her!”</p>"
    + "<p>But the doctor was not so sure of himself. He turned the case over and over in his mind as he walked to the chemist's shop, wondering how such a state of exhaustion and collapse could have been brought about.</p>"
    + "<p>The baby had her first dose and the doctor had just time to wash and change his travelling suit before they all met at the dinner-table.</p>"
    + "<p>Here they found the party opposite augmented by the arrival of Monsieur Alfred Brimont, a young Brussels tradesman, who had come over to Heyst to conduct his sister home. He was trying to persuade Harriet Brandt to accompany Olga and stay a few days with them, but the girl—with a long look in the direction of Captain Pullen—shook her head determinedly.</p>"
    + "<p>“O! you might come, Harriet, just for a few days,” argued Olga, “now that the <i>Bataille de Fleurs</i> is over, there is nothing left to stay for in Heyst, and Alfred says that Brussels is such a beautiful place.”</p>"
    + "<p>“There are the theatres, and the Parc, and the Quinconce, and Wauxhall!” said young Brimont, persuasively.  “Mademoiselle would enjoy herself, I have no doubt!”</p>"
    + "<p>But Harriet still negatived the proposal.</p>"
    + "<p>“Why shouldn't we make up a party and all go together,” suggested the Baroness, “me and the Baron and Bobby and 'Arriet? You would like it then, my dear, wouldn't you?” she said to the girl, “and you really should see Brussels before we go 'ome! What do you say, Gustave? We'd go to the Hotel de Saxe, and see everything! It wouldn't take us more than a week or ten days.”</p>"
    + "<p>“Do as you like, mein tear,” acquiesced the Baron.</p>"
    + "<p>“And why shouldn't you come with us, Captain?” continued Madame Gobelli to Ralph. “You don't look quite the thing to me! A little change would do you good. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!  'Ave you been to Brussels?”</p>"
    + "<p>“I lived there for years, Madame, and know every part of it!” he replied.</p>"
    + "<p>“Come and renew your acquaintance then, and take me and 'Arriet about!! The Baron isn't much good when it comes to sight-seeing, are you, Gustave? 'E likes 'is pipe and 'is slippers too well! But you're young and spry! Well! is it a bargain?”</p>"
    + "<p>“I really could not decide in such a hurry,” said Ralph, with a glance at Margaret and Elinor, “but we might all go on to Brussels perhaps, a little later on.”</p>"
    + "<p>“I don't think you must buoy up the hopes of the Baroness and Miss Brandt with that idea,” remarked Miss Leyton, coldly, “because I am sure that Mrs. Pullen has no intention of doing anything of the sort. If you wish to accompany Madame Gobelli's party, you had better make your arrangements without any reference to us!”</p>"
    + "<p>“All right! If you prefer it, I will,” he answered in the same indifferent tone.</p>"
    + "<p>“<em>Who</em> is that young lady sitting opposite, with the dark eyes?” demanded Doctor Phillips of Mrs. Pullen.</p>"
    + "<p>“The same I spoke to you of, upstairs, as having been kind to baby—Miss Harriet Brandt!”</p>"
    + "<p>“I knew a Brandt once,” he answered. “Has she anything to do with the West Indies?”</p>"
    + "<p>“O! yes! she comes from Jamaica! She is an orphan, the daughter of Doctor Henry Brandt, and has been educated in the Ursuline Convent there! She is a young lady with an independent fortune, and considered to be quite a catch in Heyst!”</p>"
    + "<p>“And you and Miss Leyton are intimate with her?”</p>"
    + "<p>“She has attached herself very much to us since coming here. She has few friends, poor girl!”</p>"
    + "<p>“Will you introduce me?”</p>"
    + "<p>“Miss Brandt, my friend, Doctor Phillips, wishes for an introduction to you.”</p>"
    + "<p>The usual courtesies passed between them, and then the doctor said,</p>"
    + "<p>“I fancy I knew your father, Miss Brandt, when I was quartered in Jamaica with the Thirteenth Lances.  Did he not live on the top of the Hill, on a plantation called Helvetia?”</p>"
    + "<p>“That was the name of our place,” replied Harriet, “but I left it when I was only eleven. My trustee, Mr.  Trawler, lives there now!”</p>"
    + "<p>“Ah! Trawler the attorney! I have no doubt he made as much out of the property as he could squeeze.”</p>"
    + "<p>“Do you mean that he cheated me?” asked Harriet, naively.</p>"
    + "<p>“God forbid! my dear young lady. But he was a great crony of your father's, and a d—d sharp lawyer, and those sort of gentry generally feather their own nest pretty well, in payment of their friendship.”</p>"
    + "<p>“He can't do me any harm now,” said Harriet, “for I have my property in my own hands!”</p>"
    + "<p>“Quite right! quite right! that is, if you're a business woman,” rejoined the doctor. “And are you travelling all by yourself?”</p>"
    + "<p>Harriet was about to answer in the affirmative, when the Baroness took the words out of her mouth.</p>"
    + "<p>“No, Sir, she ain't! She came over with her friend, Mademoiselle Brimont, and now she's under my chaperonage.  She's a deal too 'andsome, ain't she? to be travelling about the world alone, with her money-bags under her arm. My name's the Baroness Gobelli,—this is my 'usband, Baron Gustave Gobelli, and this is my little boy, Bobby Bates—by my first 'usband, you'll understand—and when you return to London, if you like to come and see Miss Brandt at our 'ouse—the Red 'Ouse, 'Olloway, we shall be very pleased to see you!”</p>"
    + "<p>“I am sure, Madame, you are infinitely kind,” replied Doctor Phillips gravely.</p>"
    + "<p>“Not at all! You'll meet no end of swells there, Prince Loris of Taxelmein, and Prince Adalbert of Waxsquiemer, and 'eaps of others. But all the same we're in trade, the Baron and I—and we're not ashamed of it either. We make boots and shoes! Our firm is Fantaisie et Cie, of Oxford Street, and though I say it, you won't find better boots and shoes in all London than ours. No brown paper soles, and rotten uppers! Not a bit of it! It's all genuine stuff with us. You can take any boot out of the shop and rip it to pieces, and prove what I say! The best materials, and the best workmen, that's our principle, and it answers. We can't make 'em fast enough!”</p>"
    + "<p>“I have no doubt of it,” again gravely responded the old doctor.</p>"
    + "<p>“Ah! you might send some of your patients to us, Doctor, and we'll pay back by recommending you to our friends. Are you a Gout man? Prince Adalbert 'as the gout awfully! I've rubbed 'is feet with Elliman's Embrocation, by the hour together, but nothing gives 'im relief!  Now if you could cure 'im your fortune would be made! 'E says it's all the English climate, but <em>I</em> say it's over-eating, and 'e'd attend more to a medical man, if 'e told 'im to diet, than 'e will to me!”</p>"
    + "<p>“Doubtless, doubtless!” said the Doctor, in a dreamy manner. He seemed to be lost in a reverie, and Margaret had to touch his arm to remind him that the meal was concluded.</p>"
    + "<p>She wanted him to join the others in a promenade and see the beauties of Heyst, but he was strangely eager in declining it.</p>"
    + "<p>“No! no! let the youngsters go and enjoy themselves, but I want to speak to you, <em>alone</em>.”</p>"
    + "<p>“My dear doctor, you frighten me! Nothing about baby, I hope!”</p>"
    + "<p>“Not at all! Don't be foolish! But I want to talk to you where we cannot be overheard.”</p>"
    + "<p>“I think we had better wait till the rest have dispersed then, and go down upon the sands. It is almost impossible to be private in a hotel like this!”</p>"
    + "<p>“All right! Get your hat and we will stroll off together.”</p>"
    + "<p>As soon as they were out of earshot, he commenced abruptly,</p>"
    + "<p>“It is about that Miss Brandt! You seem pretty intimate with her! You must stop it at once. You must have nothing more to do with her.”</p>"
    + "<p>Margaret's eyes opened wide with distress.</p>"
    + "<p>“But, Doctor Phillips, for what reason? I don't see how we could give her up now, unless we leave the place.”</p>"
    + "<p>“Then leave the place! You mustn't know her, neither must Miss Leyton. She comes of a terrible parentage.  No good can ever ensue of association with her.”</p>"
    + "<p>“You must tell me more than this, Doctor, if you wish me to follow your advice!”</p>"
    + "<p>“I will tell you all I know myself! Some twelve or thirteen years ago I was quartered in medical charge of the Thirteenth Lances, and stationed in Jamaica, where I knew of, rather than knew, the father of this girl, Henry Brandt. You called him a doctor—he was not worthy of the name. He was a scientist perhaps—a murderer certainly!”</p>"
    + "<p>“How horrible! Do you really mean it?”</p>"
    + "<p>“Listen to me! This man Brandt matriculated in the Swiss hospitals, whence he was expelled for having caused the death of more than one patient by trying his scientific experiments upon them. The Swiss laboratories are renowned for being the foremost in Vivisection and other branches of science that gratify the curiosity and harden the heart of man more than they confer any lasting benefit on humanity. Even there, Henry Brandt's barbarity was considered to render him unfit for association with civilised practitioners, and he was expelled with ignominy. Having a private fortune he settled in Jamaica, and set up his laboratory there, and I would not shock your ears by detailing one hundredth part of the atrocities that were said to take place under his supervision, and in company of this man Trawler, whom the girl calls her trustee, and who is one of the greatest brutes unhung.”</p>"
    + "<p>“Are you not a little prejudiced, dear Doctor?”</p>"
    + "<p>“Not at all! If when you have heard all, you still say so, you are not the woman I have taken you for.  Brandt did not confine his scientific investigations to the poor dumb creation. He was known to have decoyed natives into his Pandemonium, who were never heard of again, which raised, at last, the public feeling so much against him, that I am glad to say that his negroes revolted, and after having murdered him with appropriate atrocity, set fire to his house and burned it and all his property to the ground. Don't look so shocked! I repeat that I am <em>glad</em> to say it, for he richly deserved his fate, and no torture could be too severe for one who spent his worthless life in torturing God's helpless animals!”</p>"
    + "<p>“And his wife—” commenced Margaret.</p>"
    + "<p>“He had no wife! He was never married!”</p>"
    + "<p>“Never married! But this girl Harriet Brandt—”</p>"
    + "<p>“Has no more right to the name than you have!  Henry Brandt was not the man to regard the laws, either of God or man. There was no reason why he should not have married—for that very cause, I suppose, he preferred to live in concubinage.”</p>"
    + "<p>“Poor Harriet! Poor child! And her mother, did you know her?”</p>"
    + "<p>“Don't speak to me of her mother. She was not a woman, she was a fiend, a fitting match for Henry Brandt!  To my mind she was a revolting creature. A fat, flabby half-caste, who hardly ever moved out of her chair but sat eating all day long, until the power to move had almost left her! I can see her now, with her sensual mouth, her greedy eyes, her low forehead and half-formed brain, and her lust for blood. It was said that the only thing which made her laugh, was to watch the dying agonies of the poor creatures her brutal protector slaughtered. But she thirsted for blood, she loved the sight and smell of it, she would taste it on the tip of her finger when it came in her way. Her servants had some story amongst themselves to account for this lust.  They declared that when her slave mother was pregnant with her, she was bitten by a Vampire bat, which are formidable creatures in the West Indies, and are said to fan their victims to sleep with their enormous wings, whilst they suck their blood. Anyway the slave woman did not survive her delivery, and her fellows prophecied that the child would grow up to be a murderess. Which doubtless she was in heart, if not in deed!”</p>"
    + "<p>“What an awful description! And what became of her?”</p>"
    + "<p>“She was killed at the same time as Brandt, indeed the natives would have killed her in preference to him, had they been obliged to choose, for they attributed all the atrocities that went on in the laboratory to her influence.  They said she was ‘Obeah’ which means diabolical witchcraft in their language. And doubtless their unfortunate child would have been slaughtered also, had not the overseer of the plantation carried her off to his cabin, and afterwards, when the disturbance was quelled, to the Convent, where, you say, she has been educated.”</p>"
    + "<p>“But terrible as all this is, dear Doctor, it is not the poor girl's fault. Why should we give up her acquaintance for that?”</p>"
    + "<p>“My dear Margaret, are you so ignorant as not to see that a child born under such conditions cannot turn out well? The bastard of a man like Henry Brandt, cruel, dastardly, Godless, and a woman like her terrible mother, a sensual, self-loving, crafty and bloodthirsty half-caste—what do you expect their daughter to become? She may seem harmless enough at present, so does the tiger cub as it suckles its dam, but that which is bred in her will come out sooner or later, and curse those with whom she may be associated. I beg and pray of you, Margaret, not to let that girl come near you, or your child, any more. There is a curse upon her, and it will affect all within her influence!”</p>"
    + "<p>“You have made me feel very uncomfortable, Doctor,” replied Mrs. Pullen. “Of course if I had known all this previously, I would not have cultivated Miss Brandt's acquaintance, and now I shall take your advice and drop her as soon as possible! There will be no difficulty with Miss Leyton, for she has had a strange dislike to the girl ever since we met, but she has certainly been very kind to my baby—”</p>"
    + "<p>“For Heaven's sake don't let her come near your baby any more!” cried Doctor Phillips, quickly.</p>"
    + "<p>“Certainly I will not, and perhaps it would be as well if we moved on to Ostende or Blankenburghe, as we have sometimes talked of doing. It would sever the acquaintance in the most effectual way!”</p>"
    + "<p>“By all means do so, particularly if the young lady does not go to Brussels, as that stout party was proposing at dinner time. What an extraordinary person she appears to be! Quite a character!”</p>"
    + "<p>“That is just what she is! But, Doctor, there is another thing I should like to speak to you about, concerning Miss Brandt, and I am sure I may trust you to receive it in the strictest confidence. It is regarding my brother-in-law, Ralph Pullen. I am rather afraid, from one or two things I have observed, that he likes Miss Brandt—O! I don't mean anything particular, for (as you know) he is engaged to be married to Elinor Leyton and I don't suspect him of wronging her, only—young men are rather headstrong you know and fond of their own way, and perhaps if you were to speak to Ralph—”</p>"
    + "<p>“Tell me plainly, has he been carrying on with this girl?”</p>"
    + "<p>“Not in the sense you would take it, Doctor, but he affects her company and that of the Gobellis a good deal. Miss Brandt sings beautifully, and Ralph loves music, but his action annoys Elinor, I can see that, and since you think we should break off the intimacy——”</p>"
    + "<p>“I consider it most imperatively necessary, for many reasons, and especially in the case of a susceptible young man like Captain Pullen. She has money, you say—”</p>"
    + "<p>“Fifteen hundred a year, so I am told!”</p>"
